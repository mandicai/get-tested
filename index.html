          <h1>Test I Ever Had</h1>
          <p>Good sex education teaches us that every sexually active individual should get tested at least once a year.
            The CDC recommends that <i>"all adults and adolescents from ages 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV."</i> Sexually
            active individuals should get tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia yearly, and individuals who have multiple or anonymous partners should
            consider getting tested more frequently, i.e. every 3-6 months.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's wise to get regularly tested and openly converse about one's sexual health with a new partner(s) as the baseline etiquette. But sex
            education still leaves some questions unanswered.

            For example, what are the window periods of some common STD's? (<i>A <b>window period</b> is defined as the period during which a standard
            test for the STD may produce a false negative</i>). How are common STD's spread? (skin-to-skin, through bodily fluids, etc.) Which STD's
            are more common than others?

# get-tested

### Intro

Good sex education teaches us that every sexually active individual should get tested.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that "all adults and adolescents from ages 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV." Sexually active individuals should get tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia yearly, and individuals who have multiple or anonymous partners should
consider getting tested more frequently, i.e. every 3-6 months.

It's wise to get regularly tested and openly converse about one's sexual health with a new partner(s)as the baseline etiquette. But sex education still leaves some questions unanswered.

For example, what are the window periods of some common STDs? (A window period is defined as the period during which a standard test for the STD may produce a false negative). How are common STDs spread? (skin to skin, through bodily fluids, etc.) Which STDs are generally asymptomatic? Which STDs are treatable vs curable?
